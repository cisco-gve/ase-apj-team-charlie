In order to process human language for interaction purpose, I relied on a Natural Language Processing platform, API.ai to 
integrate with Cisco Spark. It can be "trained" to understand human language and give responses accordingly. 

For more features, this platform opens APIs for more web services you want to intergrate with, and it has machine learning 
capbilities to be more intelligently with sufficient training.
